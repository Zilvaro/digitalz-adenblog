## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the HTML code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.
 
W3C Markup Validator found the following errors concerning index.html.

![index.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/index_validation_errors.jpg)

The errors were solved by removing the aria-label attribute from the nav, as well as removing the invalid closing Div tag.

![index.html validation](assets/testing_files/index_validation.jpg)



W3C Markup Validator also found a great amount of errors in pages with user input. However, I found those errors to be coming from the Summernote editor. See example below:

![Summernote HTML errors image](assets/testing_files/summernote_errors.jpg)


### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code of the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors. 

W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings on my CSS.

![CSS validation image](assets/testing_files/css_validation.png)


### Pyhton

Pylint was used continuously during the development process to analyze the Python code for programming errors.

[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was further used to validate the Python code to validate the Python code for PEP8 requirements. See below the validation results and the reviewed results. 


| Location | Errors / Warnings | Code Reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ./question/admin.py | No errors / warnings |![admin.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/pep8_admin.png) |

### JavaScript

[JSHints JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the site's JavaScript code. 

No errors were found.


## Accessibility

Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools has been used to confirm that the colors and fonts being used throughout the website are easy to read and accessible. See reports in the table below:

## Tools Testing

### [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

Chrome DevTools was used during the development process to test, explore and modify HTML elements and CSS styles used in the project.


### Responsiveness

* [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to check responsiveness of the site pages across different devices.

* Chrome DevTools was used to test responsiveness in different screen sizes during the development process.
